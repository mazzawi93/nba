\chapter{Background}

\textit{Give a background on basketball, sports predictions in general, sports predictions on basketball and theoretical concepts used in the report.}

\section{Basketball}
Basketball is a popular sport played by teams with 5 players on each side.  Seasons are played across two years, beginning in October and ending in April of the following year.  For the purposes of this paper, when a season is discussed for example the 2016 season, it will be in reference to the 2015-16 season.

There are 5 players on court per team, each with their own responsibilities summarized below by position \cite{player_criteria}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Point Guard:} They are the play maker, the ball is usually in their hands.  They organize the team's play and control the intensity of play.
	\item \textbf{Shooting Guard:}
	\item \textbf{Small Forward:}
	\item \textbf{Power Forward:}
	\item \textbf{Centre:}
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Concepts}

\subsection{Poisson Distribution}
The Poisson distribution is defined by the formula \cite{poisson}

\begin{equation}
p_x(\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}
\end{equation}
