# Optimal Team Formation for Fantasy Basketball

This repository contains Anthony Mazzawi's MSc Dissertation for the University of Southampton.  

Currently attempting to adapt Dixon and Robinson's english football model to basketball.  The main assumption of the model is that the number of goals scored by the home and away teams are independent poisson variables whose means are determined by the attack and defense quality of each team.  The Dixon and Robinson model uses goal times to determine those parameters.  Other factors that determine the scoring rates include injury time (Last minute of a basketball quarter) and the current score.
